# Polygonization with K-Means
In our project, we try to generate low-poly representations of images with modest computational resources while minimizing the amount of information lost from the original image.

One approach for generating low-poly representations with limited computational power is edge detection followed by triangulation on points selected from the edges. However, basic edge detection only encodes information about the magnitude of difference in color between areas of the image, and will often select superfluous feature points.

We expand on this method by encoding information about the position in the image, the specific color values, and the intensity for each pixel. Using k-means clustering on these features, we hope to achieve better semantic encoding prior to triangulation, thereby minimizing information loss. 

If our method is successful, it will allow everyone--especially artists or indie game developers who may lack the resources to utilize compute-intensive deep learning approaches to image segmentation--access to a tool to generate low-poly mockups of images that better represent the original image compared to mockups generated by simple edge detection followed by triangulation.
